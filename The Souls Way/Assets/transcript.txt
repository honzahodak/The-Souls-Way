You are a soul lost in the Ethereal Realm, a metaphysical realm between life and death. To reach your destination—a promised redemption or rebirth—you must travel the Way of souls, where every step forward requires leaving a piece of yourself behind. You have to overcome trials that test the core of your being.

During your journey you will encounter soul fragments like this one. Go and Collect it

These fragments will grant you new powers. This one gave you ability to split you soul into two. One will remain stationary, while the second appears at the last Soul Well.

Before you split your soul, Be sure to create a new soul well.  ""But beware, you can create them only if you have enough power.""

As you can see you have become translucent, that is because you have lost part of your soul. If you were to split again your soul would be too thin and you would be lost forever. But don't worry you can always come back to reclaim your lost souls.

Your journey wont be easy though. Beware of spikes and other traps, that are trying to stop you from reaching your destination



Good Luck on your journey
